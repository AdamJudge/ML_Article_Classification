    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Both models possess good quality confusion matrices with no majority classes selected with low levels of false positives/negatives. From this, the SGD method of multiclass classification is our preferred method.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above confusion matrix, the classifier is better at categorizing US-News from Sport and Music as can be seen by the higher TP rate in the lower right hand corner of the confusion matrix relative to the other two TP values. This was expected as this category is more distinct compared to Music and Sport. The abundance of mentions of Trump and Biden in the dataset no doubt made it easier for the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sport and music are broadly similar, with Music being the most difficult to categorise out of the three categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated model is able to categorize with an accuracy of approximately 88% from small snippets of articles."
